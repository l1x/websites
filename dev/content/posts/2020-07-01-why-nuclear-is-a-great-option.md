## History

History of energy usage is very long. There are many aspects of energy use that are not well known outside of energy engineering. 

## Correlations

Child mortality and energy use

# The challenge

    How to get enough reliable energy without impacting the climate?

Before we are trying to answer this question, let's go through our options.

## Types of energy

### Renewables

#### Solar & wind

Solar and wind generate energy 30% of the time, depending on the weather. There is no solar power overnight, and there is no wind power when the wind does not blow. This averages around 30% depending on which country you are talking about. Sahara has more sunny hours per year than Ireland. Another problem with renewables that since it is not under our control sometimes, these generate too much energy. It seems like a non-issue, but in fact, it introduces problems with controlling the energy grid. More on that later.

There are many countries investing in solar because it has better characteristics than wind (less fluctuation) and there are many promising projects trying to address energy efficiency.

#### Hydro

Hydropower or water power is power derived from the energy of falling water or fast running water. The cost of hydropower is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable energy. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity. Hydropower is expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydro is great because it has very predictable yield and somewhat controllable, even though it requires massive projects that change the landscape quite a bit.

### Fossil 

#### Coal

A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity. Probably the worst type of energy. Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range from 1.7 to 0.2 million years ago. Evidence for the controlled use of fire by Homo erectus, beginning some 1,000,000 years ago. Evidence of widespread control of fire by anatomically modern humans dates to approximately 125,000 years ago. 


The coal burning produces several products that are bad:

- particulates
- sulfur dioxide 
- nitrogen oxide
- heavy metals (unlined coal ash)
- radioactivity (unlined coal ash)

That is right, coal power plants produce radioactivity. Radioactive elements from coal and fly ash may come in contact with the general public when they are dispersed in air and water or are included in commercial products that contain fly ash. The radiation hazard from airborne emissions of coal-fired power plants was evaluated in a series of studies conducted from 1975-1985. These studies concluded that the maximum radiation dose to an individual living within 1 km of a modern power plant is equivalent to a minor, perhaps 1 to 5 percent, increase above the radiation from the natural environment. In fact, the fly ash emitted by a power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy. [See more](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/). According to the industry’s own data, more than 95% of the coal ash ponds in the United States are [unlined](https://earthjustice.org/features/map-coal-ash-contaminated-sites). Worse than that, based on that data, 91% of these plants are contaminating groundwater with toxic substances at levels exceeding federal safety standards. Most of the people who are talking about nuclear vs coal are not aware of these details, not aware of the heavy metal poising of soil and water, not aware of the amount of radioactivity pushed into the environment. 

The energy density of coal, that is its heating value, is roughly 24 megajoules per kilogram[41] (approximately 6.7 kilowatt-hours per kg). For a coal power plant with a 40% efficiency, it takes an estimated 325 kg (717 lb) of coal to power a 100 W lightbulb for one year.

### Natural gas

### Nuclear

Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. As a nuclear technology, nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay, and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium. Nuclear is the second-largest low-carbon power source in the world today, accounting for 10% of global electricity generation. It is second only to hydropower at 16%. For advanced economies – including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Japan – nuclear has been the biggest low-carbon source of electricity for more than 30 years and remains so today. It plays an important role in electricity security in several countries. Quite often the criticism against nuclear power is the two major disasters that happened, namely Chernobyl and Fukushima. These arguments are easily refuted. More on that later.


## Storing energy

There are very few options when it comes to storing energy. Batteries are out of the question because of the following problems: 

- capacity
- charge efficiency	
- cycle durability


## Comparing energy sources

To make a fair comparison we need to pick a unit that makes it easy for us to compare these sources. The right metric is a ​number of deaths per TWh energy produced. With this​ unit,​ we can compare how many people died while producing 1 Terawatt-hour energy.

Nuclear energy was considered the safest energy source, even after the inclusion of nuclear catastrophes like Chernobyl and Fukushima as the vast amount of energy generated offsets these events long-term. The reason for this is two fold. One is energy density, second is the extreme strict regulation on handling nuclear waste.
