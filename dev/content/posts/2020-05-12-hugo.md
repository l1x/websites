After many years on Jekyll I think the time is right to move to Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go using Liquid templating. After working with Hugo for couple of days, here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
- fast
- lots of functionality built in

Cons:
- documentation is useless for starters
- it is not intuitive what is going on
- most how-to start with using a complex template

Based on these I this it is worth to write up how to get started.

## Creating a new empty project

I am assuming you know how to install it on you OS and you are using Hugo 0.70.0 or compatible.

```bash
hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.70.0/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

If you already have a directory you can navigate into it and issue the following:

```bash
hugo new site .
```

This generates the following skeleton:

```bash
$ find .
.
./archetypes
./archetypes/default.md
./content
./layouts
./static
./config.toml
./data
./themes
```

There really important parts for getting started:

- config.toml, this has the site configuration
- content, it has the md files that will be rendered
- layouts, html files used for the rendering of the content
- static, static content that you can reference with in html wihtout any path so static/my_cat.jpg (on disk) -> /my_cat.jpg (in html)

## Rendering the empty site

Running hugo without any parameters will render (the right now empty) site.

```bash
$ hugo
Building sites â€¦ WARN 2020/05/14 15:09:57 found no layout file for "HTML" for kind "taxonomyTerm":

You can ignore the warnings for now, we will fix them later.

The content of the folder after rendering:

```bash
$ find .
.
./archetypes
./archetypes/default.md
./resources
./resources/_gen
./resources/_gen/images
./resources/_gen/assets
./content
./public
./public/index.xml
./public/tags
./public/tags/index.xml
./public/sitemap.xml
./public/categories
./public/categories/index.xml
./layouts
./static
./config.toml
./data
./themes
```

The site got rendered into the public/ folder.

There are few see your site. Hugo has a built in HTTP server (hugo server) or you can use (python -m http.server). Using hugo server is better because it will automatically reload your site when you save anything in the hugo folder.

Using the D flag will include the draft content in the render.

```bash
hugo server -D
Web Server is available at http://localhost:53905/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
```

Opening the site will show you a completely empty page. Lets add some content to it.

## The bare minimal site

For the minimal example we need to create the following files

- layouts/_default/baseof.html
- layouts/index.html

baseof.html:

Content for the files:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ block "main" . }} 
      <!-- content comes here -->
    {{ end }}
  </body>
</html>
```
index.html:

```html
{{ define "main"}}
  <div>Greetings!</div>
{{ end }}
```
Voila! Your new static site is up and running.

Few things to note:

- hugo uses a rule set to determine which layout it renders your content with

You can read about it more here: https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/

- defaults live in _default

- using baseof.html is a good idea (not sure why the documentation is not starting with this)

## Adding CSS

Your website cannot live without CSS. Lets add some. I really like Tachyons and I imagine you might want to use something similar. The process is the same of any css file.

Creating the folder:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/css
```

You can download the CSS file and put in in that folder or you can use it on your site with a CDN. I prefer to host it myself.

```bash
wget https://your.framework.com/awesome.css -O assets/css/awesome.css
```

On the top of that you might want to use some custom CSS too.

```bash
touch assets/css/style.css
```

Lets add these to our site. Before we do that. Let's introduce a new concept, partials. Partials are a good way to have small chunks of HTML that you want to add to many pages of your site. For example, HTML header (that loads the CSS for example) might look the same across all of you pages. Let's create a partial for that.

```bash
mkdir -p layouts/partials
```

We are creating a HTML file, layouts/partials/header.html with the following content:

```HTML
{{ $awesome := resources.Get "css/awesome.css" | resources.Minify }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $awesome.RelPermalink }}">

{{ $style := resources.Get "css/style.css" | resources.Minify }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $style.RelPermalink }}">
```

This will add the CSS entries wherewer we include this partial. We can include it in baseof.html.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/> 
    
    {{ partial "header" . }}
    
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ block "main" . }} 
      <!-- content comes here -->
    {{ end }}
  </body>
</html>
```

So far so good, CSS is loaded. Now, you can go down many paths going forward. In this guide I try to cover one way of building a landing page, that has only few HTML files and a bit of CSS. Even this can be done many ways. I am not sure if this is the right way, but this is how I did it for our landing page.

## Adding more pages

You can go and try to find what is the way to add more pages to your website. My google searches were less then sufficient and I could find some angry people and some less the productive threads about this. One example

https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/679

At this stage I am not even sure that you can do simple matching between files in content and layouts so I accepted that Hugo forces you to create folders instead.

My content looks like this:

content/about.md -> /about/index.html

The layout is layout/about/single.html.

about.md:

(There is no point)

```markdown
---
type: "about"
title: "About"
date: 2020-05-12T14:31:21+02:00
description: "About"
tags:
    - about
draft: false
---
```
