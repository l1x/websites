## Abstract

Hashing

```Python

# Each pixel is an entry in the internal array. If the array slot is empty, it's drawn as white.
# If the array slot is filled: it's drawn with a color. So then i just create an image that is sqrt(arrayLength) wide and tall.
# It also helps that, at the time, i was using a prime number probe. I've since switched to linear probe - cause cache hits.

import siphash
from bitarray import bitarray

def get_siphash(s, key):
  sip = siphash.SipHash_2_4(key)
  sip.update(bytes(s, 'utf8'))
  return sip.hexdigest().decode('utf-8')

def get_siphash_int(s, key):
  sip = siphash.SipHash_2_4(key)
  sip.update(bytes(s, 'utf8'))
  return sip.hash()

a = bitarray()

for i in range(216553):
