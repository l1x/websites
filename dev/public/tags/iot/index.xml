What is this? Elafi is a DNS proxy that filters out unwanted content by returning 0.0.0.0 to the A and ::/0 to AAAA requests that try to resolve ad/spam/malware domains.
In my home network this is roughly 10 - 30% of traffic depending on the part of the day and what devices are active. I find it outrageous that I have to look at ads on a device that I purchased, using my internet connection that I paid for and spend CPU time (producing CO2) to look at completely irrelevant ads, sometimes even malware installers.</description></item></channel></rss>
