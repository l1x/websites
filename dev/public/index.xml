Why? I am tired of dealing with configuration files and interpreters that has the expresiveness of Go, safetiness of C and performance of Ruby. Illegal configuration must be made impossible by the type system. ADTs are great for this. Compilation has to check as much as possible and using all language features is a must. C# has libraries for pretty much every single vendor out there or it is trivial to implement the lacking support.</description></item><item><title>Elafi</title><link>https://dev.l1x.be/projects/elafi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 14:31:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dev.l1x.be/projects/elafi/</guid><description>Elixir Ads Filter (ελάφι) ελάφι
What is this? Elafi is a DNS proxy that filters out unwanted content by returning 0.0.0.0 to the A and ::/0 to AAAA requests that try to resolve ad/spam/malware domains.
In my home network this is roughly 10 - 30% of traffic depending on the part of the day and what devices are active. I find it outrageous that I have to look at ads on a device that I purchased, using my internet connection that I paid for and spend CPU time (producing CO2) to look at completely irrelevant ads, sometimes even malware installers.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://dev.l1x.be/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 22:02:43 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://dev.l1x.be/about/</guid><description>About Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The easiest way is to use a simple tracking 1x1 pixel or beacon that collects just the right amount of information (strictly non-PII).</description></item><item><title>How long will the world’s uranium supplies last?</title><link>https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/05/01/how-long-will-the-worlds-uranium-supplies-last/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 14:31:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/05/01/how-long-will-the-worlds-uranium-supplies-last/</guid><description>Basics With a complete combustion or fission, approx. 8 kWh of heat can be generated from 1 kg of coal, approx. 12 kWh from 1 kg of mineral oil and around 24,000,000 kWh from 1 kg of uranium-235. Related to one kilogram, uranium-235 contains two to three million times the energy equivalent of oil or coal. The illustration shows how much coal, oil or natural uranium is required for a certain quantity of electricity.</description></item><item><title>FreeNAS 11.3 upgrade issues</title><link>https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/04/29/freenas-11.3-upgrade-issues/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:31:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/04/29/freenas-11.3-upgrade-issues/</guid><description>I have an interesting experience with the latest upgrade of FreeNAS 11.3-U2.1.

I was running into Mitchell Perilstein&amp;rsquo;s excellent work on NTP with Erlang and I thought I am going to use this to explain how bitstrings and binaries work in Erlang.
Two concepts:
A bitstring is a sequence of zero or more bits, where the number of bits does not need to be divisible by 8.</description></item></channel></rss>
