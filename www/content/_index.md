# Welcome

Welcome on my personal website. You can find information about my projects and ideas here.

## Projects

### Elafi

Erlang/Elixir Ad Filter

It would be great to have a simple service written in a single language that can run on developer boards like Raspberry Pi or similar. Erlang is a great option for many reasons.

### CloudClamp

I would like to have a strongly typed tool that deploys my infrastructure, primarily on AWS, sometimes on Cloudflare or Azure.

## About

I was born in Hungary and graduated from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 2003. I have been working in energy trading for a while, managing the entire country's schedule in Excel (your read it right). Wild times.

I started to work in Germany for IBM on the CELL project in 2006. It was amazing experience, starting as a test engineer, working on the lowest layer of the stack. There was a guy who fixed kernel hoops with a soldering tool.

When the financial crisis hit in 2008 I was moving to Dublin to start my systems engineer career. Worked for Amazon a while, mostly on the website. It was most definitely the best learning opportunity I ever had. A little bit of drinking from the fire hydrant situation though.

California. Do I need to say more? This is where things happen. I was working for Riot Games as a data engineer, get to know Riak and Erlang a bit more in depth.

I moved up north for few years before I came back to the EU.

Back home, doing consultancy work mostly in Germany and Luxembourg.
